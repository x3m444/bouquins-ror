bouquins-ror
============

Web frontend for calibre e-book manager.

Features
========

Bouquins is a Ruby On Rails application. The web UI uses bootstrap.

It allows to browse, search and download e-books from a calibre library using a web browser (desktop/mobile).

It needs a local access to all files in the calibre library (including the sqlite database file: metadata.db). Synchronisation of those files on the server is not part of the application (personnaly I use owncloud).
